Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.



ps. It is clear that I've abused of python conveniences. Checking the min and max values manually together with a couple of IF's, we should get a more efficient solution.

#TODO check the time difference between the different approches and size of array to which this difference is "significant"
