HackerRank problems solutions

The problems solved here are originated from the [HackerRank site](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
Inside the directories one can find a minimal description of the problem and my codeto solve it. For now there is only python code, but I want to add some Rust solutions soon.
 Some problems may have a extra text file with some observations like: bugs, algorithm limitations, possible alternative algorithms and so on...
